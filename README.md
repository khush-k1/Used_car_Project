# Used_car_Project
In this project we collect the data of the used cars from the websites, and use that data to build a ML model to Predict the price.
We use car_dataset.xlsx for model building, writing report, and presentation while usedcar_dataset.xlsx is the new excel sheet, with some additional data and its code is mentioned in the car_ data_collection.ipynb project.
